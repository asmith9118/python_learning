    "Information on data in python that may be useful: \n",
    "Users of Python are often drawn-in by its ease of use, one piece of which is dynamic typing. While a statically-typed language like C or Java requires each variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically-typed language like Python skips this specification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Python implementation is written in C. This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of Python's dynamic typing, we can even create heterogeneous lists, but this flexibility comes at a cost: to allow these flexible types, each item in the list must contain its own type info, reference count, and other informationâ€“that is, each item is a complete Python object. "
